The authorship of Genesis is a complex question that scholars have debated for centuries. Here's what we know:

**Traditional view**: Jewish and Christian tradition has long attributed the first five books of the Bible (the Pentateuch, including Genesis) to Moses. This view was nearly unanimous until the modern era.

**Modern scholarly consensus**: Most biblical scholars today believe Genesis was written by multiple authors over several centuries, likely compiled and edited into its final form during or after the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE). This is based on evidence like:
- Different writing styles and vocabulary within the text
- Duplicate stories with variations (like two creation accounts)
- Anachronisms (references to things that didn't exist in Moses's time)
- The account of Moses's death at the end of Deuteronomy

**Middle ground positions**: Some scholars believe Genesis contains ancient traditions that may trace back to Moses's era or earlier, even if the final written form came later.

**Conservative religious view**: Many traditional Jews and Christians still maintain Mosaic authorship, sometimes allowing for minor later editorial additions.

The text of Genesis itself doesn't explicitly claim Moses as its author. The question ultimately depends on whether you're approaching it from a faith-based perspective that accepts traditional religious teaching, or from a historical-critical academic perspective that examines the text's literary and historical evidence.
