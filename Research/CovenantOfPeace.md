In the **Tanakh**, the **“covenant of peace”** (*berit shalom*) is not a single concept but a **theme expressed through several covenants and prophetic promises**. It refers to a divinely guaranteed state of **wholeness, harmony, security, and restored relationship** between HaShem, Israel, humanity, and creation. The Hebrew word *shalom* means far more than absence of war—it implies completeness, well-being, justice, and right order.

Below is a structured discussion of the covenant of peace as it appears in the Tanakh.

---

## 1. Meaning of “Covenant” (*Berit*) and “Peace” (*Shalom*)

* **Berit (covenant):** A binding relationship established by HaShem, often accompanied by promises, obligations, and signs.
* **Shalom:** Wholeness, welfare, flourishing, moral harmony, and stability.

A “covenant of peace” therefore means **a binding divine commitment to preserve and restore wholeness**, not merely political tranquility.

---

## 2. Covenant of Peace with Phinehas (Numbers 25:10–13)

### Text

> “Behold, I give him My covenant of peace (*berit shalom*). It shall be for him and for his descendants after him a covenant of eternal priesthood…” (Num. 25:12–13)

### Significance

* **Context:** Phinehas zealously acts to stop Israel’s moral collapse at Baal Peor.
* **Peace here is moral and spiritual**, not passive. It is achieved through restoring covenant fidelity.
* The covenant ensures:

  * Continuity of priesthood
  * Stability between HaShem and Israel
* Paradoxically, peace follows **zeal for holiness**, not compromise.

This is the **only place in the Torah where the phrase “covenant of peace” appears explicitly**.

---

## 3. The Priestly Blessing and Shalom (Numbers 6:24–26)

> “The Adonai lift up His face toward you and give you peace.”

While not explicitly called a covenant, this blessing:

* Defines peace as **the climax of divine favor**
* Connects peace with:

  * HaShem’s presence
  * Protection
  * Grace

It lays theological groundwork for later covenantal peace promises.

---

## 4. Covenant of Peace in the Prophets

### A. Isaiah: Everlasting Covenant of Peace

> “For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall My covenant of peace be removed” (Isaiah 54:10)

Key ideas:

* The covenant of peace is **everlasting**
* It survives judgment and exile
* Rooted in **chesed** (steadfast love), not Israel’s merit
* Associated with restoration after suffering

---

### B. Ezekiel: Covenant of Peace and Restoration

#### Ezekiel 34:25

> “I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land…”

#### Ezekiel 37:26

> “I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant.”

Key themes:

* **Physical security** (safety, land, prosperity)
* **Spiritual renewal** (HaShem dwelling among them)
* **Messianic overtones** (Davidic shepherd-king)
* Peace includes harmony between:

  * HaShem and Israel
  * Humans and nature
  * People among themselves

This covenant reverses exile and fragmentation.

---

## 5. Covenant of Peace and the Davidic Covenant

While not always named explicitly:

* The **Davidic covenant** (2 Samuel 7) underlies prophetic peace visions
* Peace is tied to:

  * A righteous king
  * Justice (*mishpat*)
  * Righteousness (*tzedakah*)

> “Justice and righteousness are the foundation of Your throne” (Psalm 89:14)

Peace without justice is not covenantal peace in the Tanakh.

---

## 6. Peace, Torah, and Covenant Faithfulness

The Tanakh consistently teaches:

* **Peace is conditional at the national level**:

  * Obedience → peace and prosperity (Leviticus 26:6)
  * Disobedience → conflict and exile
* Yet **HaShem’s ultimate covenant of peace is unconditional**, rooted in divine mercy (Isaiah 54; Ezekiel 37)

Thus there is a tension:

* Immediate peace depends on obedience
* Ultimate peace depends on HaShem’s faithfulness

---

## 7. Theological Summary

The **covenant of peace in the Tanakh**:

* Is **relational**, not merely political
* Includes:

  * Moral order
  * Justice
  * Divine presence
  * Security and flourishing
* Looks forward to:

  * Restoration after exile
  * A renewed Israel
  * Universal harmony under HaShem’s rule

Peace is not the absence of conflict but the **presence of HaShem’s ordered, life-giving rule**.

# Rabbinic Interpretations

Below is an overview of **rabbinic interpretations of the “covenant of peace” (*berit shalom*)**, drawing from **Midrash, Talmud, and classical commentators**. Rabbinic thought does not treat *shalom* as a single doctrine but as a **foundational principle that sustains the covenantal order of the world**.

---

## 1. *Shalom* as a Name and Attribute of HaShem

### Talmudic Teaching

> “The Holy One, blessed be He, is called Peace”
> (Shabbat 10b)

**Implication:**

* Peace is not merely a divine gift but a **manifestation of HaShem’s presence**.
* To preserve peace is to preserve the **divine name** itself.
* This explains why greetings of peace (*shalom aleichem*) carry spiritual weight.

Rabbinic theology thus views the covenant of peace as **participation in HaShem’s own attribute**, not only a promised outcome.

---

## 2. Phinehas and the Paradox of Peace (Numbers 25)

### Midrashic Tension

Rabbinic sources struggle with the fact that **an act of violence** leads to a *covenant of peace*.

#### Key Interpretations:

* **Sanhedrin 82b:** Phinehas acted with *pure intention* (*lishmah*), not personal anger.
* **Midrash Tanchuma (Pinchas 1):** HaShem grants peace to Phinehas to **heal his soul**, which was endangered by bloodshed.
* **Zohar (III, 217b):** Phinehas unites the divine attributes of **justice and mercy**, preventing cosmic rupture.

### Broken Vav Tradition

* In the Torah scroll, the word *shalom* (Num. 25:12) is written with a **broken letter vav**.
* Rabbinic symbolism:

  * Perfect peace does not exist in a broken world.
  * Peace achieved through zeal is **inherently fragile** and must be safeguarded.

---

## 3. Peace as the Purpose of Torah

### Mishnah and Talmud

> “All the ways of the Torah are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace”
> (Proverbs 3:17; cited in Gittin 59b)

> “The entire Torah was given to make peace in the world”
> (Gittin 59b)

**Rabbinic conclusion:**

* Even commandments that seem strict or divisive ultimately aim toward peace.
* Legal rulings (*halakhah*) are often modified **“for the sake of peace” (*mipnei darkhei shalom*)**.

Thus, the covenant of peace is **embedded within halakhic reasoning**, not only prophetic vision.

---

## 4. Peace as the Vessel for Blessing

### Sifre on Numbers 6

> “Great is peace, for all blessings are contained within it.”

* The priestly blessing culminates in peace because:

  * Without peace, blessings cannot endure.
  * Peace is the **container** (*keli*) that holds divine abundance.

This idea reinforces the covenantal notion that peace is **structural**, not optional.

---

## 5. Peace, Truth, and Compromise

### Midrashic Debate

> “Let truth pierce the mountain; let peace prevail”
> (Jerusalem Talmud, Sanhedrin 1:1)

Rabbinic balance:

* **Truth without peace can destroy**
* **Peace without truth can corrupt**

HaShem Himself is portrayed as **altering truth to preserve peace**, as in:

* HaShem’s words to Abraham about Sarah’s laughter (Genesis 18; Yevamot 65b)

This suggests that the covenant of peace sometimes **overrides strict factual accuracy** for relational integrity.

---

## 6. Peace and Messianic Expectation

### Rabbinic Eschatology

* The Messiah is called:

  * *Sar Shalom* (Prince of Peace – Isaiah 9:5)
* Talmudic vision:

  * Universal peace is not fully attainable until the **end of days** (Berakhot 64a).

### Avot 1:12

> “Be among the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace.”

Peace is not passive; it must be **actively pursued**, mirroring HaShem’s covenantal pursuit of Israel.

---

## 7. Cosmic Peace: Creation Sustained by Shalom

### Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 12:15)

* Creation stands upon:

  * Justice
  * Truth
  * Peace

Peace holds opposites together, preventing collapse into chaos.

In this sense, the covenant of peace is **cosmic**, not only national or individual.

---

## 8. Summary of Rabbinic Themes

Rabbinic Judaism understands the covenant of peace as:

* A **divine attribute** shared with humanity
* A **goal of Torah and halakhah**
* A **healing force** after moral rupture
* A **balance** between justice and mercy
* A **future promise** fulfilled messianically
* A **fragile achievement** in an imperfect world

Peace is both **given by HaShem** and **entrusted to human responsibility**.
