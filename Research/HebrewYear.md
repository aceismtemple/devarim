## When is year 1 of hebrew calendar?

The Hebrew calendar begins with year 1 in **3761 BCE** (or 3760 BCE, depending on the time of year, since the Hebrew year begins in the fall).

This starting point is traditionally calculated as the date of creation according to Jewish tradition, specifically representing the sixth day of creation when Adam and Eve were created. The calculation was formalized by Jewish scholars in the medieval period, though it's based on chronologies found in the Hebrew Bible.

So the current Hebrew year (as of January 2026) is 5786, meaning 5,786 years have passed since that traditional creation date. The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning it follows lunar months but adds leap months periodically to stay aligned with the solar year and seasons.


## According to archeologists, what is happening on 3761 BCE?

According to archaeologists and historians, 3761 BCE falls during the **Chalcolithic period** (Copper Age) in the Near East, a time of significant but gradual technological and social development. Here's what was happening around that time:

**In the Levant/Mesopotamia:**
- Small agricultural villages and early towns were developing
- People were beginning to use copper tools alongside stone tools
- Early irrigation systems were being developed in Mesopotamia
- Writing hadn't been invented yet (cuneiform wouldn't appear until around 3200 BCE)
- The first cities and complex civilizations were still centuries away

**In Egypt:**
- This predates the unification of Egypt and the pharaonic dynasties by about 700-800 years
- Egypt was in its Predynastic period with scattered communities along the Nile
- The pyramids wouldn't be built for another 600+ years

**Globally:**
- Agriculture had already been established for thousands of years in various regions
- Humans had been anatomically modern for over 100,000 years
- Complex hunter-gatherer societies existed, and some were transitioning to agriculture

So from an archaeological perspective, 3761 BCE was a time of gradual human development—important in the long arc of history, but not marking any particular dramatic event. This contrasts with the Hebrew calendar's theological significance, which marks it as the moment of divine creation.


## Who starts the hebrew calendar?

 The Hebrew calendar as we know it was likely **formalized and systematized by Jewish scholars in the Talmudic and early medieval periods**, particularly around the **4th-10th centuries CE**. Here are the key figures and developments:

**Key Contributors:**

1. **Hillel II** (4th century CE, around 358-359 CE) - Often credited with establishing the fixed, calculated Hebrew calendar that's still used today. Before this, the calendar was determined by observation of the new moon and declarations by the Sanhedrin (Jewish court) in Jerusalem. After the destruction of the Second Temple and the dispersal of Jewish communities, a fixed mathematical calendar became necessary.

2. **Earlier Talmudic scholars** (1st-5th centuries CE) - Developed many of the calendar's rules and calculations in the Mishnah and Talmud.

3. **Medieval Jewish astronomers and mathematicians** - Further refined the calculations and chronology, including determining the "year 1" date.

**The Creation Date Calculation:**

The specific date of 3761 BCE as year 1 comes from chronological calculations based on:
- Biblical genealogies (counting generations from Adam)
- Reign lengths of kings mentioned in the Bible
- Prophetic timelines
- Rabbinic interpretations

This calculation appears to have been solidified by medieval scholars, though earlier rabbis had worked on biblical chronology. Different Jewish traditions actually had slightly varying calculations before consensus formed.

So while the calendar has ancient roots, its current fixed form is really a product of late antiquity and the early medieval period.

## Why do the calculations seem imprecise given that many people reportedly lived up to 900 years before Noah's flood?


The biblical chronology before the flood does indeed present difficulties for historical calculation, and this is one reason why the Hebrew calendar's year 1 date should be understood as **theological rather than historical**.

**The Biblical Problem:**

In Genesis, the pre-flood patriarchs are recorded as living extraordinarily long lives:
- Adam: 930 years
- Seth: 912 years
- Methuselah: 969 years (the longest)
- Noah: 950 years

**Why This Creates Vagueness:**

1. **Literal vs. Symbolic Interpretation** - Even among traditional Jewish scholars, there's been debate about whether these numbers should be taken literally or symbolically. Some possibilities suggested over the centuries:
   - They represent different counting systems
   - They refer to dynasties or lineages rather than individuals
   - They're symbolic of righteousness or importance
   - The "years" meant something different

2. **No Archaeological Evidence** - There's no archaeological or biological evidence of humans living to 900+ years, which makes these figures impossible to verify or correlate with actual historical events

3. **Different Manuscript Traditions** - The Hebrew (Masoretic), Greek (Septuagint), and Samaritan texts actually have *different numbers* for these ages and genealogies, leading to different total calculations

**The Result:**

Jewish scholars who calculated the calendar essentially **accepted the biblical numbers at face value for religious purposes**, adding up the generations as given in their tradition (the Masoretic text). They weren't trying to create a scientifically accurate historical timeline—they were creating a religious calendar that counted years from the traditional date of creation according to their sacred texts.

This is why modern scholars view it as a **theological/liturgical** calendar rather than a historical one.
