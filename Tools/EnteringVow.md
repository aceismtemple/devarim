**Noahide Vow**

I, [Your Name], standing before the God of Israel and in the presence of this community, solemnly commit myself to the path of righteousness as a Noahide.

I pledge to uphold the **Seven Noahide Laws**, embracing the principles that guide all humanity toward justice, kindness, and holiness:

1. To acknowledge and honor the One God of Israel.
2. To abstain from idolatry and false worship.
3. To refrain from blasphemy and speak with reverence of the God of Israel.
4. To respect and preserve human life.
5. To live with honesty, avoiding theft and deceit.
6. To honor and uphold the sanctity of marriage and moral conduct.
7. To care for and respect all of the God of Israel’s creation, promoting justice in society.

I vow to study and seek understanding of these divine laws, to practice them faithfully in my life, and to teach by example through acts of kindness, compassion, and integrity.

May the God of Israel guide me, strengthen me, and bless my path as I strive to live a life in accordance with His will.

So I pledge, and so I vow.
