The Noahide laws don't specifically forbid eating halal food. The Noahide laws consist of seven basic moral principles that, according to Jewish tradition, were given to Noah and are binding on all humanity.

Halal is the Islamic dietary code that determines which foods are permissible for Muslims. Halal meat preparation involves slaughtering the animal while invoking the name of Allah, ensuring the animal is healthy at the time of slaughter, and draining the blood.

From a Noahide perspective, the main concern with any meat would be that it doesn't come from a living animal (the 6th Noahide law). Since halal slaughter involves properly killing the animal before consumption, it doesn't violate this principle.

Some strict interpretations might raise concerns about the invocation of Allah during halal slaughter, viewing it as potentially related to idolatry. However, mainstream Jewish authorities generally recognize Allah as referring to the same God worshipped in Judaism, so this wouldn't typically be considered idolatrous.

The recognition that Muslims worship the same God comes from later medieval Jewish legal authorities and philosophers who lived in Islamic lands and grappled with how to view Islam from a Jewish legal perspective. Some key figures include:

Maimonides (Rambam, 12th century) - He explicitly stated that Islam is monotheistic and not idolatrous. He lived in Islamic societies and wrote some of his works in Arabic.

Other Rishonim (medieval rabbis) - Various authorities developed the position that Muslims are strict monotheists worshipping the God of Abraham.

Therefore, halal food is generally considered permissible under the Noahide laws.
