**The Head Elder may voluntarily take on more rules or practices than the core seven**, but with three key qualifications:

1. The **extra rules must be clearly understood as personal or communal enhancements**, not as additional *Divine commandments* that every Gentile is obligated to keep.  
2. He may **not create or imply a new binding religious covenant** that parallels or alters the Torah’s covenant with Israel (e.g., inventing a “new 8th law” revealed by HaShem to Noahides).  
3. If the added practice is a *Jewish* mitzvah (e.g., wearing tefillin, keeping full Shabbat), he must do it **only as a custom or ethical aid**, not as a commandment he is *obligated* to observe, and should seek halachic guidance so it does not resemble a counterfeit “Noahide conversion.”  

Traditional sources already acknowledge this:  
- Talmudic tradition lists **30 ancient “fence” laws** that post-Flood societies adopted to protect the seven (e.g., extra dietary or sexual restrictions); these were civil statutes, not capital offenses.  
- Medieval and modern authorities say a Noahide may accept **any of the 613 Torah mitzvot** that have moral or logical appeal—charity, prayer, modesty, etc.—provided they are kept **voluntarily and without claiming Divine obligation**.  
- The “Law of Courts” obligation even encourages Noahide societies to enact **righteous civil legislation** (traffic rules, health codes, anti-usury statutes) beyond the seven, so long as the penalties are not cruel and the populace accepts them.
