## Who is Noah

Noah is a significant figure in the Bible, particularly in the Book of Genesis. He is most famous for building the **ark** that saved his family and pairs of animals from the **Great Flood**, which HaShem sent to cleanse the earth of widespread wickedness.

### **1. Noah’s Righteousness**

Noah was a righteous man in a corrupt world.

> *“Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with HaElohim.”* — **Genesis 6:9**

HaShem saw that humanity had become very wicked, and He decided to cleanse the earth with a flood.

### **2. HaShem’s Command to Build the Ark**

HaShem instructed Noah to build an ark to save his family and the animals.

> *“So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. This is how you are to build it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around.”* — **Genesis 6:14-16**

Noah obeyed HaShem exactly.

### **3. Gathering the Animals**

Noah was told to bring animals into the ark to preserve life.

> *“Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.”* — **Genesis 7:2-3**

---

### **4. The Flood**

The flood came, covering the earth and destroying everything outside the ark.

> *“And the rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.”* — **Genesis 7:12-13**

The waters remained for 150 days.

### **5. The Ark Rests**

After the flood, the ark came to rest on Mount Ararat.

> *“The ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. The waters receded steadily from the earth.”* — **Genesis 8:4-5**

---

### **6. Leaving the Ark**

Noah and the animals left the ark, and he offered a sacrifice to HaShem.

> *“Then Noah built an altar unto Hashem and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.”* — **Genesis 8:20**

HaShem was pleased and made a covenant with Noah.

---

### **7. HaShem’s Covenant**

HaShem promised never to destroy the earth by flood again and gave the rainbow as a sign.

> *“I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth… I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.”* — **Genesis 9:11, 13**

## After the flood, the story of Noah continues

### **1. Noah’s Family and New Life on Earth**

After leaving the ark, Noah and his family began repopulating the earth. HaShem blessed them:

> *“Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.”* — **Genesis 9:1**

HaShem also gave humans permission to eat animals for food, but He forbade eating **blood**, emphasizing the sanctity of life:

> *“Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.”* — **Genesis 9:3-4**

---

### **2. HaShem’s Covenant with Noah**

HaShem made a permanent covenant with Noah and all living creatures, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again. The **rainbow** was the sign of this covenant:

> *“I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.”* — **Genesis 9:13**

This was a major moment—it showed HaShem’s mercy and His commitment to humanity after the flood.

---

### **3. Noah’s Sons**

Noah had three sons: **Shem, Ham, and Japheth**, who would become the ancestors of all nations after the flood.

* **Shem** → ancestors of Semitic peoples (including Hebrews/Israelites)
* **Ham** → ancestors of some African and Near Eastern nations
* **Japheth** → ancestors of many European and some Asian peoples

> *“Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. He drank some of the wine and became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.”* — **Genesis 9:20-21**

This story leads to a key incident involving **Ham’s disrespect** and the cursing of Canaan (Ham’s son).

---

### **4. The Curse of Canaan**

After Noah became drunk, his son Ham saw him naked and told his brothers, Shem and Japheth, who respectfully covered Noah. When Noah awoke, he cursed Ham’s son Canaan:

> *“Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.”* — **Genesis 9:25**

Shem and Japheth, however, were blessed. This story explains the division of nations and descendants after the flood.

---

### **5. Noah’s Death**

Noah lived a long life after the flood—**950 years** in total—and then died:

> *“Noah lived 350 years after the flood. Noah lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.”* — **Genesis 9:28-29**

After his death, the Bible moves on to the story of his descendants, leading eventually to Abraham and the rest of the biblical narrative.
