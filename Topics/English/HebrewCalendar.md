The **Hebrew calendar** (also called the Jewish calendar) is a **lunisolar calendar**, which means it takes into account both the **moon’s cycles** and the **solar year**. This is why Jewish holidays sometimes fall on different Gregorian calendar dates each year but remain in the same **season**. Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 1. **Months**

* The Hebrew calendar is based on **months that follow the lunar cycle**.
* Each month is **29 or 30 days**, reflecting the 29.53-day lunar cycle.
* There are **12 months in a regular year**, but a leap year has **13 months** to keep the calendar aligned with the solar year (so holidays stay in their proper seasons).

**The months:**

1. **Nisan** – 30 days (spring, Passover occurs here)
2. **Iyar** – 29 days
3. **Sivan** – 30 days (Shavuot)
4. **Tammuz** – 29 days
5. **Av** – 30 days (Tisha B’Av)
6. **Elul** – 29 days
7. **Tishrei** – 30 days (Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot)
8. **Cheshvan** – 29 or 30 days
9. **Kislev** – 29 or 30 days
10. **Tevet** – 29 days
11. **Shevat** – 30 days
12. **Adar** – 29 days

**In leap years**, an extra month called **Adar I (30 days)** is added before Adar (which becomes **Adar II, 29 days**) to keep the calendar in sync with the seasons.

### 2. **Years**

* A Hebrew year is **either 12 or 13 months**.
* Regular year: ~354 days
* Leap year: ~384 days
* Years are counted **from the traditional date of Creation** (Anno Mundi, AM). For example, the current year 2026 CE is **5786 AM** in the Hebrew calendar.

### 3. **Leap Years**

* The Hebrew calendar uses a **19-year cycle** called the **Metonic cycle**.
* In this cycle, there are **7 leap years**: years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19.
* Leap years add **Adar I** so festivals like **Passover** stay in **spring**.

---

### 4. **Days**

* Days start **at sunset**, not at midnight. This is why Shabbat and holidays begin **Friday evening**.
* Each day has **24 hours**, divided into hours and parts (halakim).

---

### 5. **Holidays**

* The calendar is crucial for Jewish holidays.
* Example: **Passover** is on 15 Nisan, **Yom Kippur** on 10 Tishrei.
* Because it’s lunisolar, holidays shift slightly in the Gregorian calendar but **always remain in the correct season**.

---

### 6. **Special Rules**

* The calendar uses **mathematical rules** to avoid certain holidays falling on specific weekdays:

  * For example, Yom Kippur **cannot fall on Friday or Sunday**.
* Months Cheshvan and Kislev can be adjusted to make the year **deficient, regular, or complete** (353–355 days).

---

In short, the Hebrew calendar is a **carefully calculated mix of lunar months and solar years**, ensuring both that holidays fall in the correct **seasons** and that the lunar months roughly align with the **moon phases**.
