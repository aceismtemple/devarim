## Are Noahides permitted to celebrate Jewish festivals, and if so, in what way?

The **classical Jewish answer is: it depends on *how* and *why***.

Below is the **mainstream Talmudic–halakhic framework**, not a modern opinion.

---

## 1. Core principle: Noahides should not observe Jewish festivals as *commandments*

Jewish holidays (Shabbat, Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, etc.) are **signs of the covenant between God and Israel**.

**Talmud – Sanhedrin 58b**
A non-Jew should not “make a day of rest like Shabbat” as a religious obligation.

**Rambam, Hilkhot Melakhim 10:9**:

> A non-Jew who observes a mitzvah in order to practice it as commanded is not permitted—except the Seven Laws.

This applies to **festivals as obligations**, not to learning or respectful participation.

---

## 2. What a Noahide should *not* do

A Noahide should **not**:

* Observe **Shabbat** as a day of religious rest
* Keep **Pesach** as a commanded ritual (seder as obligation, matzah as mitzvah)
* Sit in a **sukkah** as fulfillment of a command
* Celebrate Jewish festivals **as if bound by Jewish law**
* Say blessings that include phrases like *“who commanded us”*

That crosses into **covenantal imitation**, which Judaism discourages.

---

## 3. What *is* permitted and often encouraged

A Noahide **may**:

### A. Acknowledge Jewish events historically or theologically

Examples:

* Recognizing **Passover** as God redeeming Israel
* Honoring **Shavuot** as the giving of Torah *to Israel*
* Marking **Rosh Hashanah** as a time of moral self-reflection
* Reflecting on **Yom Kippur** themes (repentance, mercy)

This is **recognition**, not observance.

---

### B. Participate as a guest, not as an obligated observer

A Noahide may:

* Attend a **Passover seder** as an invited guest
* Visit a sukkah socially
* Join educational or interfaith events

Key distinction:

> *“I am learning / honoring / supporting Israel”*
> not
> *“I am fulfilling this commandment.”*

---

### C. Create Noahide-appropriate commemorations

Many rabbinic authorities encourage Noahides to:

* Thank God for creation
* Celebrate moral milestones
* Mark days of gratitude to the Creator
* Reflect on justice, repentance, and mercy

These should be **distinctly Noahide**, not copies of Jewish rites.

---

## 4. Why Judaism draws this boundary

Judaism teaches:

* Israel’s covenant is **particular**
* Humanity’s covenant is **universal**
* Blurring them harms both

**Zech. 8:23**:

> “Ten people from the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying: ‘We will go with you, for God is with you.’”

They *walk together*, but do not become the same.

---

## Summary

* ❌ Noahides should not **observe Jewish festivals as religious obligations**
* ✅ They may **honor, learn about, and respectfully participate**
* ✅ They may draw **universal moral lessons**
* ✅ They should develop **their own Noahide identity**
