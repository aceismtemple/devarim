## Excommunication in Jews

Excommunication in Jewish communities has a long and nuanced history, with several distinct forms and purposes that have evolved over time.

**The Three Traditional Forms**

Jewish tradition developed three main levels of exclusion, listed in order of severity:

*Niddui* (נידוי) was a temporary separation, typically lasting 30 days (or 7 days in Israel). During this period, the person was expected to avoid social gatherings, though others could still interact with them in limited ways. The individual would show signs of mourning—not bathing, cutting hair, or wearing fine clothing. This was meant to encourage repentance and reconciliation.

*Cherem* (חרם) was more severe—a complete ban. The excommunicated person was to be avoided entirely, and others couldn't do business with them, eat with them, or even come within a certain distance (traditionally four cubits, about six feet). Their children might be excluded from school, and they couldn't participate in communal religious activities. A cherem could be temporary or permanent.

*Shamta* (שמתא) was similar to cherem but sometimes considered even more stringent, though the terms are often used interchangeably in later sources.

**Grounds for Excommunication**

Historically, excommunication could be imposed for various reasons: violating Jewish law (particularly publicly), showing contempt for rabbinic authority, refusing to appear before a religious court (*beit din*), informing on fellow Jews to secular authorities, causing harm to the community, or heresy.

The procedure typically required a rabbinic court and sometimes involved dramatic ceremonies—blowing the shofar, extinguishing candles, or pronouncing formal curses.

**Famous Historical Cases**

Perhaps the most famous excommunication was that of Baruch Spinoza in 1656 Amsterdam. The Portuguese-Jewish community issued an extraordinarily harsh cherem against the young philosopher for his heterodox views, declaring that he should be "cursed by day and cursed by night; cursed when he lies down and cursed when he rises up." This ban was never lifted.

Other notable cases include Uriel da Costa (also in Amsterdam, 1640), who was excommunicated for questioning rabbinic authority and later reconciled but tragically committed suicide; and various Sabbatean followers after the false messiah Sabbatai Zevi's apostasy.

**Modern Practice**

In contemporary times, formal excommunication is quite rare in most Jewish communities. When it does occur, it's primarily in Orthodox circles, particularly among Hasidic groups.

Modern Orthodox communities might use less formal social exclusion rather than official cherem. Someone might be denied synagogue honors, excluded from serving in community roles, or face social ostracism without a formal decree.

Reform and Conservative movements generally don't practice excommunication at all, viewing it as incompatible with modern values of individual autonomy and pluralism.

**Contemporary Issues**

When excommunication-like measures do occur today, they often involve: individuals who convert to other religions, those who inform to secular authorities (though this is increasingly controversial), people who openly violate core community standards in ways that cause scandal, or individuals involved in serious disputes with rabbinic authorities.

There's significant debate within Orthodox communities about the appropriateness of these measures. Some argue they're necessary to maintain community standards and protect vulnerable members. Others contend they're often misused, can cause tremendous suffering to families, and may be counterproductive in bringing people back to observance.

**The Tension**

The modern tension around excommunication reflects broader questions in Jewish life: How does a community maintain boundaries and standards while also showing compassion? How much authority should religious leaders have over individuals? How do ancient practices translate into contemporary democratic societies with different values around personal freedom?

Some communities have found middle ground—using social consequences rather than formal bans, or limiting excommunication to the most extreme cases like abuse or endangering others.

## Excommunication in Noahides

Excommunication in Noahide communities is an interesting and somewhat complex topic, since the Noahide movement doesn't have the same centralized religious authority structure that exists in many other faith traditions.

**Traditional Jewish Law Perspective**

In classical Jewish sources, there isn't a formal excommunication process specifically outlined for Noahides (Gentiles who observe the Seven Noahide Laws). The concept of *cherem* (excommunication) in Jewish law was primarily developed for the Jewish community itself. However, some rabbinical authorities have discussed how community discipline might work for Noahides.

**Modern Noahide Communities**

In contemporary Noahide communities, the situation varies considerably:

Some communities have developed their own guidelines for dealing with members who violate the Seven Laws or cause significant disruption. This might involve removal from community gatherings, online forums, or study groups rather than formal religious excommunication in the traditional sense.

Since Noahides don't have a unified governing body, different communities and organizations handle these matters differently. Some are overseen by rabbis who may provide guidance on such issues, while others are more autonomous.

In practice, most Noahide communities handle discipline issues more informally than through formal excommunication. The approach often depends on several factors:

**What typically happens:**

Communities might remove someone from participation if they're actively violating the Seven Laws, teaching false doctrine, causing division, or behaving abusively toward other members. This usually means being removed from study groups, chat forums, or community events.

**Who makes these decisions:**

If your community has a rabbi or religious authority who guides it, they often provide direction on these matters. Some communities have elected leaders or councils who handle administrative decisions. 

## The goal

Most communities see this as protective rather than punitive - maintaining a safe environment for sincere seekers and protecting the integrity of the teaching. There's usually hope for reconciliation if someone changes their behavior.

## **Community Disciplinary Process**

### **Level 1: Private Warning**

**When applied:** Minor violations, first-time issues, or behavior that may be unintentional

**Process:**
- A community leader or designated member speaks privately with the individual
- The concern is explained clearly with reference to the Seven Laws or community standards
- The person is given opportunity to explain their perspective
- Guidance is offered on correct behavior
- A reasonable timeframe for correction is established (typically 2-4 weeks)

**Documentation:** Brief note kept confidentially by leadership

---

### **Level 2: Formal Admonition**

**When applied:** Repeated minor violations, failure to correct after private warning, or more serious first-time offenses

**Process:**
- Meeting with two community leaders/elders and the individual
- Written statement outlining the specific violations
- Clear expectations for behavioral change
- May include temporary restrictions (limited participation in certain activities, moderated posting privileges, etc.)
- Accountability partner or mentor assigned if appropriate
- Timeframe for review (typically 1-3 months)

**Documentation:** Written record shared with individual and kept by leadership

---

### **Level 3: Suspension**

**When applied:** Continued violation after formal admonition, serious violations of the Seven Laws, teaching false doctrine, or causing significant harm to community members

**Process:**
- Temporary removal from community activities and platforms
- Duration clearly specified (typically 3-6 months)
- Conditions for reinstatement clearly outlined
- Regular check-ins offered (monthly) to assess progress and provide support
- Individual may be required to study specific materials or meet with rabbi/mentor
- Opportunity for the individual to address leadership before final decision

**Documentation:** Full written record; individual receives written notice

---

### **Level 4: Removal from Community**

**When applied only after:**
- All previous steps have been exhausted without improvement, OR
- Severe violations that pose immediate danger (abuse, severe Torah violations, predatory behavior)

**Process:**
- Final review by leadership team and/or overseeing rabbi
- Written notification with explanation
- Door remains open for future reconciliation with clear conditions
- Other community members informed appropriately (balance between transparency and privacy)

---

### **General Principles:**

1. **Mercy and Justice:** Balance firm standards with compassion and hope for repentance
2. **Privacy:** Keep matters as private as possible while ensuring safety
3. **Proportionality:** Response should match the severity and pattern of behavior
4. **Due Process:** Person always has right to be heard and understand accusations
5. **Spiritual Focus:** Goal is restoration and growth, not punishment
6. **Appeal Process:** Mechanism for appealing decisions to rabbi or elder council
