## 1. Board-Elected Successor of Head Elder

**How it works**

* When the leader steps down, the Board of members elects the new Head Elder.
* Board members are Elders and significant members like leaders.
* Regular members do not vote.
* Decision requires supermajority (e.g., ⅔ or unanimity).

**Process**

1. Vacancy is declared (planned or sudden).
2. Board opens nominations.
3. Elders will undergo fasting and prayer for at least 2 days before voting.
4. Board votes internally.
5. New Head Elder is formally appointed.
